One of AGCO’s key compliance activities is inspecting and monitoring licensed establishments to ensure compliance with the Liquor Licence Act and regulations.

The AGCO is in the process of strategic planning of liquor establishment inspection activities and is looking to derive and leverage insights from the liquor establishment inspection data.

Of particular interest are current infractions that have been found while inspecting licensed establishments as they represent outcomes of inspection activities. The AGCO management is interested in insights on how these infractions might be better identified, detected and strategically addressed in future, given establishments’ attributes and other data that is available in the Data.csv file.
